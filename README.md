# ColorSwitch
Attempt at making the Color Switch game.

To run the game, use an IDE (I used IntelliJ) . Clone the repository, add JavaFX library.
Go to the src folder and build the system and run game.class and enjoy playing.

You can also see the PPT attached which goes by the name "Project details" for more insights.
